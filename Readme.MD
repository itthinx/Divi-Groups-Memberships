# Divi Groups Memberships

A Divi child theme that partially reveals the content of posts to visitors and fully to those who have active memberships. Relies on and requires Groups to handle memberships https://wordpress.org/plugins/groups/ and also supports Groups Restrict Categories https://www.itthinx.com/shop/groups-restrict-categories/

The typical use case for this theme would be a Newspaper site that offers premium content to paying members. While excerpts of posts are shown to anyone, only paying members would have access to their full content.

Please note that this works for Posts only (not for any other post type and this is intentional). It will show the excerpt for protected posts to unauthorized visitors, while revealing the full content to authorized members. Authorized members in that sense are group members who are logged in.

To protect a post with Groups, please refer to http://docs.itthinx.com/document/groups/access-control/posts-and-pages/ for details.

We recommend to use Groups WooCommerce to sell memberships https://www.itthinx.com/shop/groups-woocommerce/
